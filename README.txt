Diabetes Prediction Using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
This project demonstrates the use of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict diabetes progression based on the Diabetes dataset from sklearn. The model is built, trained, and evaluated with steps to preprocess the data and improve the model's performance.

Requirements
Python 3.7+
Libraries:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
tensorflow
keras
Install the required packages using the command:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
Steps in the Project
1. Loading and Preprocessing
The Diabetes dataset is loaded from sklearn.datasets.
Features are normalized using StandardScaler for better performance of the ANN.
Missing values are handled if present.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Distribution of the target variable (progression) is visualized.
Relationships between features and the target variable are explored using scatter plots.
3. Building the ANN Model
An ANN model is designed with:
Input layer matching the number of features.
One or more hidden layers using ReLU activation.
Output layer for regression.
4. Training the ANN Model
The dataset is split into training and testing sets (80:20).
The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function.
5. Evaluating the Model
The model is evaluated on the testing data using:
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R² Score
Training and validation losses are visualized.
6. Improving the Model
Experiments are conducted with:
Additional layers and neurons.
Different learning rates and batch sizes.
Improved performance metrics are reported and compared with the initial model.
Running the Project
Clone this repository or download the code.
Ensure all dependencies are installed.
Run the Python script:
bash
Copy code
python diabetes_ann.py
View the outputs including metrics and visualizations.
Results
Baseline Model Performance:

Mean Squared Error: X.XX
R² Score: X.XX
Improved Model Performance:

Mean Squared Error: Y.YY
R² Score: Y.YY
Improvements are achieved by experimenting with the architecture and hyperparameters.
